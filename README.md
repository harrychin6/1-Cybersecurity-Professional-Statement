# Professional statement

My name is Harry. I am a results-oriented team player with a can-do attitude. Itâ€™s in my nature to continually work to improve not just my skills, but the projects I am engaged in. I have always had a passion for using technology to help people, and I believe cybersecurity is the perfect fit for that passion.

I am enthusiastic about the challenges and opportunities that the field of cybersecurity provides in order to help a business and its people. Having a strong attention to detail, I would be able to audit, implement and monitor cybersecurity threats precisely and thoroughly. 

I am driven by a deep sense of purpose and fulfilling a need. In this modern world of increasing digital connectivity, cybersecurity threats are ever increasing, so I am excited to apply my skills to defend against these cyber-attacks.
